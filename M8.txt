I know there is a shor cut for fixing formating, I would prefer to use that...bahaha I found it.
BAHAHAHAHA I create a file for the error.js referenced document AND IT WORKS. 7:45am HECK. YES.

All I need to do now is make the fact array correct, that's a probelom for future Kayleigh.
I will remove and paste the instruction code into this document for safe keeping.

The webpage is now awkwardly formatted but so is the grumpy cat example so, not sure it matters. Pretty sure its to do with the <br> tags.
